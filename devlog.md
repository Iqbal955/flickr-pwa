Can I make searches show the search terms as query parameters in the address bar?

Should I pass any query parameters as URL params rather than passing as props? This is a different approach. Right now, I update the query terms variable in App and pass it down to Search. App is above Form and Search, the latter two are siblings.

If I did the above, what effect would that have on forward and back buttons after performing a search.
